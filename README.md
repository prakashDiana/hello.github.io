The tangent of 90 degrees is **undefined**.

Here's why:

The tangent function is defined as the ratio of the sine of an angle to its cosine:
$tan(\theta) = \frac{sin(\theta)}{cos(\theta)}$

For 90 degrees:
* $sin(90^\circ) = 1$
* $cos(90^\circ) = 0$

Therefore:
$tan(90^\circ) = \frac{1}{0}$

Division by zero is undefined, so the tangent of 90 degrees is undefined.

Geometrically, if you consider the unit circle, the tangent represents the slope of the line from the origin to the point on the circle. At 90 degrees, the line is perfectly vertical, and a vertical line has an undefined slope.
